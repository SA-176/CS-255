Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    >The DriverPass project was a project for the client DriverPass who wanted a online system made for their driving instruction services. The system needed to be able to give the user access to the courses and practice test along with the scheduling for a drive with in person teacher depending on what package they were subscibed to.
    
What did you do particularly well?
    >I think I did well with the activity diagrams since it is what I'm most used to. The process of making an ordered system that connects A to B to C works well for me. 
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    >I would want to improve my UML sequence diagrams. I feel I could have chosen more complicated examples to make my diagrams of. Or tried making one that was for longer process in the project. 
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    > To interpret the user needs I put myself in to position of the user and saw what I needed to be able to access in the project. I then looked over the notes from the client requests to see where the cross and what limitations need to be put on the user according to the client. Including the user needs in the design process is what helps to ensure that the final project is usable and user friendly. 
    
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    >When designing software I first break down what a program need to do and in what orders. Then I organize what it needs to do in order of importance. This is so I can prioritize what needs to be in the project so I can build the project around those priorities. In the future I will definately incorporate more diagrams into my process. I liked to logic or the UML diagrams with system design.
